# EMS Frontend 
I used vite, react, axios, and bootstrap to create the frontend for my EMS application.
This application allows you to view a list of employees. It also gives you the ability to add new employees, update employees, and delete employees.
All of the employee data is stored in a MySQL database.
(Axios is an HTTP client library and it was used to make RESTful API requests. These API requests were handled by our ems-backend code.)
